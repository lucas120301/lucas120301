<h3>💡 Twitter Acquisition Sentiment Analysis - 
<a href="https://github.com/adamzbikowski/Twitter-Acquisition-Sentiment-Analysis">Link</a></h3>
<b>ℹ️ Description</b>
<br>In this project, we aimed to use Sentiment Analysis to Track Evolving Public Sentiment and understand how Public Perception of Influential Figures may influence Markets and Political Decisions. We focused on sources from news articles and Youtube comments to form the basis of our analysis.
<br>
  <br> <b>📗 The method </b>
<br> - Used Selenium with Youtube API, Google API to automate the search processes and generate a database of links
<br> - Web scraping of each article with BS4 and generated over 20,000 articles and 180,000 Youtube comments
<br> - Performed sentiment analysis using BERT LLM
<br> - Built our own simpler models, including VADER Dictionary, Logistic Regression, SVM, and ANNs
<br> - Interpretation and Observations
<br>
  <br> <b>🥇 Results and Limitations</b>
<br> - ⭐ First Place at the LSE Autumn Term Data Science Showcase
<br> - ⭐ Strong Correlation Observed with Significant Events​
<br> - ⭐ Good performance even for simple models​
<br> - ❗ No Correlation with Stock Price
<br> - ❗ Did not account for Posts with Images or Audio

<h3>💡 Predicting Virality of Social Media Post - 
<a href="https://github.com/lucas120301/lucas120301.github.io/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Business%20Analytics%20Using%20Python.py">Link</a></h3>
<b>ℹ️ Description</b>
  <br>This Project analyses articles from the social media site Medium. Medium is the trendy website for content creators and people with disruptive ideas, wishing to share their thoughts and experiences to build a strong community. We have chosen the most efficient/explainable regression method; logistic regression is rather adapted to classification algorithms with a large amount of categorical data. We will try to predict whether the article is viral (1) or not (0) setting a specific threshold of "claps".
  <br>
  <br> <b>📗 The method </b>
<br> - Upload Dataset from Kaggle
<br> - Cleaning data and feature elaboration
<br> - Textual analysis
<br> - Structure Dataset into "training" and "testing"
<br> - Training and Testing our method
<br> - Interpretation and observations
<br> - *bonus* Build and train a linear regression model
  <br>
  <br> <b>🥇 Results and Limitations</b>
<br> - ⭐ Our <b> accuracy: (0.87)! </b> The features selected for this model were on point!
<br> - ❗ How to define a Viral article?
<br> - ❗ Did not account for Posts with Images or Audio
